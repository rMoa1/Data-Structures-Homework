	1) What is Linked list?
A linked list its a linear data structures where elements are connected using pointers
	2)Why linked list?
Linked list has a dynamic memory allocation, which aloow us to add and rempve easily than array.
	3)What does O(1) mean?
The execution time does not depend on data size(Constnant time)
	4)What does O(n) mean?
The execution time is directly proportional to the size of the data
	5)What does O(n^2) mean?
The execution time is proportional to the square of the data, mostly in nested loops
	6)What does O(log n) mean?
The execution time proporitonally increase, size doubles in every step
	7)What does O(n log n) mean?
Mostly used in sorting, scan every element in list
